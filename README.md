# Chess
## Description
Command-line implementation of chess using ruby. The purpose of this project was to complete an assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

## Challenges
The logic needed for chess is simple enough to comprehend. My main issue with the project was managing all its components and making them work together.
Chess has many edge cases, such as castling, taking en-passant, and promotion, making creating a generalized movement system tedious. 
I learned how checks affect the player's ability to move their pieces only after I considered the project done and showed it to my friends, so I could not incorporate it.
I plan to take a break from the project for some time before implementing it since it would require significant changes to the program; I would need a fresh perspective to make those
changes clean and intuitive.

## How to Play
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the repository directory with `cd chess`
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `ruby main.rb`
